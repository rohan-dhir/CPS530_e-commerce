# E-commerce Website

This is a University project for Web Systems Development (CPS 530) where I collaborated with a group in developing this website. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our group's understanding of both front-end and back-end development.

My responsibilities included:
* Generating the necessary tables to manage our inventory
* Developing the back-end (PHP files) to query the database using MySQL
